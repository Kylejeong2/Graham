AI phone agents for growing small businesses.

This is in Kyle Jeong's Startup Graveyard.

Honestly was a good idea in my head. SMBs want enterprise level technology, but companies don't build for them.

Only issue was that they didn't have the money to take risks, and they didn't know enough about tech to take the risk and want to bet their customers on AI yet. 

I don't blame them. I should have entered the market by doing more research first and trying out with beta testers.

Instead I built 99% of the product and then tried to sell it, which business owners didn't really see as useful yet. The market will be there eventually, I'm just too early too soon.

I learned a ton about conversational AI and building voice agents. Did a ton of trial runs and learned a lot of new technologies.

This wasn't a total waste, great to learn and a huge project I built solo.
